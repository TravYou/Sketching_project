Asmitha, Shreya, and Travis all evenly split the tasks for the project. All 3 members worked together to develop the plan for the project along with the milestones that would need to be reached along the way. All three members also agreed upon delegating tasks to complete the project. Travis worked on the manual implementation of bloom and cuckoo filters, along with benchmarking for evaluation of their efficiency. Shreya worked on the quotient filter implementation and completed the relevant benchmarking for comparing the filters. Shreya and Travis both also worked on implementing the pyprobables version of the filters and benchmarking to compare them with the manual implementation. Asmitha worked on creating the data structure for storing the large collections of the sequencing reads, which included developing the code for the three different approaches including brute force, aggregated method, and SBT. She also completed benchmarking to compare the three approaches for storing k-mers and querying. All three members conducted throughout research into all aspects of the projects. For the final report, Shreya completed the Abstract and Prior Work section, Asmitha completed the Introduction, Travis completed the methods and all members helped edit each of the sections. All members also worked on Results, Conclusions, and Literature cited together.
